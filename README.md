# TodoApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.3.0.

## Development server

Run `npm start`  (not `ng serve ` for technical reasons works better this way) for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

The folder  Backend  contains the files and directories of the back end server, it should be run in an IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA ( oben backend directory on and hit Run)on port 8080 (`http://localhost:8080`)  before running the front-end angular app. It makes use of Spring Boot and H2 as in memory database. 

## Known Bugs

Date has an formal formatting and that makes it hard to validate.
## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
